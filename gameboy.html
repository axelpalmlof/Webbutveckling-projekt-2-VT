            Game Boy was not the first handheld gaming system, but it was certainly the most popular,” says Drew
            Robarge, a museum specialist at the American History Museum. “There were others before it, but they were
            mostly one-function systems. Game Boy used interchangeable cartridges, like the home consoles, so you could
            play different games.”
            The 8-bit system looks dated by todays standards: small screen with dot-matrix graphics in black and
            white—actually four shades of gray-green. However, it was durable and inexpensive to operate since it didnt
            burn through batteries like its competition.
            When first introduced in the United States 30 years ago, Nintendos new concept took the gaming community by
            storm. Game Boy sold 1 million units in this country in a few short weeks (total sales would reach nearly
            120 million worldwide in all iterations by the time its run ended 16 years later).
            Thirty Years Ago, Game Boy Changed the Way America Played Video Games
            An original 1989 console is featured next to early cell phones, PDAs and pagers in a display at the National
            Museum of American History's “American Enterprise” exhibition. National Museum of American History
            The handheld gaming system was invented by Nintendos Gunpei Yokoi, who also created the Metroid video-game
            series. He got the idea for a portable gaming system after watching a bored businessman playing with an LCD
            calculator. He then worked with Satoru Okada and the Nintendo Research & Development team to refine the
            idea, which was patented in the United States on September 24, 1985.</p>
